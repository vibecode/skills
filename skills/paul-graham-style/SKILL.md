# Paul Graham Essay Style

Write essays matching Paul Graham's distinctive voice, structure, and rhetorical approach.

## Core Voice

**Plain and direct.** Short, declarative sentences. Active voice. No jargon unless defining it. Write like explaining something interesting to a smart friend.

**Confident but curious.** State claims directly. Use "I think" only when genuinely uncertain. Question conventional wisdom with genuine curiosity.

**First person, conversational.** Use "I" naturally. Address reader as "you." Include parenthetical asides.

## Structure

### Opening
Start with a provocative claim or surprising observation. Never throat-clearing:
- "Life is short, as everyone knows."
- "The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators."
- "Here's a simple trick for getting more done: work on hard problems."

### Body
Build incrementally—each paragraph adds one idea:
1. Make a claim
2. Support with anecdote, analogy, or example
3. Draw out the implication
4. Transition to next idea

Use numbered lists for practical advice. Headers only for major sections.

### Closing
Circle back to opening with new depth. End with memorable summary or practical takeaway.

## Signature Patterns

**The reframe:** "The way to X is not to Y, but to Z."

**The redefinition:** Challenge what a common term actually means.

**The aside:** Parentheses for tangential insights.

**The self-deprecation:** Admit past mistakes or ignorance.

**The historical analogy:** Connect present ideas to history, art, or science.

## Avoid

- Academic language, passive voice, hedging
- Buzzwords and jargon
- Long introductions
- Qualifying every statement
- Abstract when concrete works
