## Opening Patterns

### The Surprising Claim
Start with something counterintuitive:
- "The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators."
- "Here's a simple trick for getting more done: work on hard problems."
- "Writing can be good in two ways: it can sound good, and the ideas can be right."

### The Universal Truth
State something everyone knows, then complicate it:
- "Life is short, as everyone knows."
- "To do something well you have to like it."
- "You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible."

### The Personal Anecdote
Ground abstract ideas in concrete experience:
- "In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb."
- "When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map of the school lunch tables according to popularity."
- "When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition."

### The Question
Open with the question you'll answer:
- "What do I mean by good people?"
- "But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it?"

## Transition Patterns

### The Pivot
Acknowledge then redirect:
- "Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?"
- "So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently unpopular?"
- "But in fact I didn't, not enough."

### The Deepening
Move from observation to implication:
- "This is more than just a figure of speech."
- "And yet this is exactly what happens."
- "The implications are alarming."

### The Qualification
Add nuance without hedging:
- "This isn't always true, but it's true often enough to be worth thinking about."
- "There are exceptions, of course."
- "To be fair, there are cases where this doesn't apply."

### The Enumeration
Structure with numbered points:
- "There are three variants of procrastination..."
- "I can think of two reasons..."
- "You need three things to create a successful startup..."

## Argument Patterns

### The Reframe
"The way to X is not to Y, but to Z":
- "The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself."
- "The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists."
- "The way to solve the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you."

### The Redefinition
Challenge what a common term means:
- "What is 'work'? It's not the same as a job."
- "Money is not wealth. Wealth is stuff we want."
- "'Taste' is the ability to recognize good design."

### The Historical Analogy
Connect to history, art, or science:
- "This is what happened with painters in the Renaissance."
- "The Florentines prospered through new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth."
- "Copernicus rejected the Ptolemaic model partly because of its ugliness."

### The Self-Deprecation
Admit past ignorance:
- "I didn't understand this until I was in my thirties."
- "I made this mistake myself."
- "Looking back, I'm amazed how much worry it caused me."

### The Counterargument
Anticipate and address objections:
- "You might think that..."
- "One argument says that this would be impossible, that..."
- "Some people will object that..."

## Closing Patterns

### The Summary Formula
Distill to actionable principle:
- "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short."
- "The formula for doing great work is: find a field that suits your abilities and interests, work hard, and explore many different things."

### The Circle Back
Return to opening with new depth:
- Opens: "Life is short, as everyone knows."
- Closes with specific practices for living accordingly.

### The Implication
End with what this means for the reader:
- "If you want to do great things, you'll have to work on hard problems."
- "Understanding this should make it less painful."

### The Call to Action
End with imperative:
- "Just don't wait."
- "So if you want to do great work, start working on something."

## Sentence-Level Patterns

### Short and Declarative
- "Life is short."
- "Money is not wealth."
- "Nerds aren't losers."
- "This is a big deal."

### The Aside
Parenthetical for tangent:
- "Most people (including me for most of my life) don't realize this."
- "The reason (as everyone knows) is that..."
- "This sounds obvious, but (surprisingly) most people don't do it."

### The List
Inline enumeration:
- "food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on"
- "operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on"

### The Contrast
Set up opposition:
- "Not X, but Y."
- "It's not that... It's that..."
- "The problem isn't... The problem is..."

### The Question-Answer
Rhetorical then answer:
- "Why? Because..."
- "How do you do this? By..."
- "What does this mean? It means..."
